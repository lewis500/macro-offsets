SHORT TERM
+ add velocity on MFD chart
+ show the MFD as things change
+ add the predictions back on the MFD chart


MACRO
+ figure out how to transition the signals better
+ recalculate the MFD in real time for the offsets ?

MICRO
+ do all the updats on the green of a single "anchor" signal
+ add coloring for instant syncing
+ make modes for time-path, fixed and macroscopic
+ put the buttons in the header, not in the app.ls
+ make a button for "recalibrate automatic"

SIGNALING
+ try instant syncing
+ add coloring for direction of syncing

+ instad of two arrays for cum, just do one. use two path-makers
+ still need to fix something about how cars enter, etc.
+ get rid of all this car-num++ stuff. just use the lodash version of map.
+ have a button to turn macro offsets on and off
+ add velocity line

LONG TERM
+ only take measurements from the ones not next to the transition
+ make the signals animate when they change
+ try deku
+ only fire the request animation frame on a tick  action
+ take care of extreme edge case where two waiting cars 
+ try checking free locations by making a big array of all the cells and setting the taken ones to true. that way, when a cell is added you can just set it to true. only works for whole-number locations, though.
want o enter the same place at the same time
trying using ^^ instead of ... to copy objects
+ try using reselect on certain stateless functions
