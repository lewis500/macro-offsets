+ only take measurements from the ones not next to the transition
+ add velocity line
+ use an underscore or PL for the prelude functions

MED TERM
+ material design
+ add offsets in
+ make a move-car function to map over the cars so that reduce-cars isn't so long

LONG TERM
+ to make hte star go faster, cache a scale that maps points along the length to coordinates instead of recalculating every time. then just pass in the object's x value and get a coordinate.
+ change font
+ make the signals animate when they change
+ make responsive
+ try deku
+ should i do gap-red - SPACE in the move-car function?
+ or...only fire the request animation frame on a tick  action

+ have a function for remaking the signals
+ rename the k state variable so it's actually n
+ simplify the moving logic for cars

try out using comparison
