+ catch edge case where the cars loop around
+ get rid of all this car-num++ stuff. just use the lodash version of map.
+ simplify all these constants
+ have a button to turn macro offsets on and off

+ dont use a scale. just have an array from 0 to road-length. then, use math.floor to get the nearest whole-number location of the car. look up that entry in the array.
+ only take measurements from the ones not next to the transition
+ add velocity line
+ use an underscore or PL for the prelude functions
+ try using memoize on certain stateless functions

LONG TERM
+ make the signals animate when they change
+ try deku
+ only fire the request animation frame on a tick  action
+ take care of extreme edge case where two waiting cars 
+ try checking free locations by making a big array of all the cells and setting the taken ones to true. that way, when a cell is added you can just set it to true. only works for whole-number locations, though.
